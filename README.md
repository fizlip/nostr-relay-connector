# GRASSR00T
GRASSR00T is a decentralized messaging platform which allows anyone in the world to connect to a *nostr relay* making it possible for open source investigators a clear view into the social and political life in places where the government censors internet applications like Twitter/Instagram/TikTok. It was inspired by the needs of open source reasearhes discussed in [this](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/04/18/china-challenges-open-source-osint-social-media/) article

I made it as part of the 2023 bellingcat accessability hackathon and had a lot of fun ðŸ˜€.
