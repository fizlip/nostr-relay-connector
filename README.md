# GRASSR00T
GRASSR00T allows anyone in the world to connect to a *nostr client* making it possible for open source investigators a clear view into the social and political life in places where the government censors internet applications like Twitter/Instagram/TikTok.

I made it as part of the 2023 bellingcat accessability hackathon and had a lot of fun ðŸ˜€.
